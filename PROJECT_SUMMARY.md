# HFT Trading Application - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This document provides a summary of the HFT Trading Application, a C++ project currently under development. The goal is to build a high-performance trading tool using C++17, SFML, and TGUI, featuring real-time market data, advanced technical analysis, and an intuitive GUI.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress. While many core features are functional, the application is not yet complete and is under active development.

### What's Working
- **Real-Time Data**: The application successfully fetches and processes live market data from the Yahoo Finance API for Nifty 50 stocks.
- **Core Logic**: Technical indicators, trading strategy processing, and signal generation are functional.
- **Terminal Display**: A terminal-based live data viewer (`live_display`) is available and working correctly.

### Known Issues
- **GUI Rendering**: The GUI window may not render correctly in all desktop environments or when running in a headless/remote setup.
- **Threading**: The application may not always shut down gracefully, sometimes resulting in `thread::join failed` errors.

## Trading Strategies Details

### 1. **Opening Range Breakout (ORB)**
```cpp
Strategy Logic:
- Calculate first 15-minute high/low range
- Enter LONG on breakout above range high
- Enter SHORT on breakdown below range low
- Stop Loss: Opposite side of range
- Target: 1.5x range size extension
```

### 2. **VWAP Strategy**
```cpp
Strategy Logic:
- Calculate intraday VWAP
- Enter LONG when price > VWAP with volume confirmation
- Enter SHORT when price < VWAP with volume confirmation
- Stop Loss: VWAP level
- Target: 2% move from entry
```

### 3. **RSI Strategy**
```cpp
Strategy Logic:
- RSI < 30: Oversold condition → BUY signal
- RSI > 70: Overbought condition → SELL signal
- Stop Loss: 2% from entry
- Target: Mean reversion to RSI 50 level
```

### 4. **Breakout Strategy**
```cpp
Strategy Logic:
- Detect price breakouts from consolidation
- Volume confirmation required (>1.5x average)
- Support/resistance level breaks
- Stop Loss: Breakout level
- Target: Measured move projection
```

### 5. **Volume Strategy**
```cpp
Strategy Logic:
- Volume spike detection (>1.8x average)
- Price-volume alignment confirmation
- Directional bias from price movement
- Stop Loss: 2% from entry
- Target: Momentum continuation
```
